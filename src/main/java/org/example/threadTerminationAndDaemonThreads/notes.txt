Why and whwn would we want to stop a thread?
Threads consume resources
Memory and kernel resources, CPU and cache
If a thread finished its work, but the application is still running, we want to cleanup the threads resources
If a thread is misbehaving, we want to stop it
By default, the applicaiton will not stop as long as at least one threads is still running


Thread.interrupt();
-> if the thread is executing a method that throws


Darmon thread
Background tasks, that should not block our application from terminating
Example: File saving thread in a Text Editor
